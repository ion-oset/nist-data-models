    """Utilities for case conversion of identifiers.

    These functions are intended to handle common identifiers and some edge
    cases, not every possible string.

    Tokens are defined by the characters allowed in Python identifiers:

        - Lower case:  [a-z]
        - Upper case:  [A-Z]
        - Digits:      [0-9]
        - Underscores: _

    Python supports full use of Unicode in symbol names, but functions here are
    dead simple and don't handle anything that isn't ASCII.

    A string must start with a set of legal characters. If it does not it has no
    tokens, even if the rest of the string would have matched.

    Leading underscores are treated as a token because they have special meaning
    in Python identifiers.
